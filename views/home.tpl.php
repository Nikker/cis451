<h1>Welcome to Shukumei!</h1>
<div class="two-thirds">
  <p>Shukumei is a private interactive website intended for artists, writers and otherwise talented and awesome people to hang out and develop characters. The Shukumei website has earned the nickname "Beta," as the site has been under ongoing construction since its initial launch in 2007 and is, to this day, still incomplete. The version of the website you're interacting with right now is a recreation of Beta, keeping good programming and database design practices in mind.</p>
